# Your agile priorities.

Before prioritizing items do a requirements review. 

> ***MMF:*** Minimum Marketable Feature.  
***MVP:*** Minumum Viable Product.  
**RoI:*** Return of interest.

Now that you have reviewed your requirements, you should make shure your user stories satisfy the **INVEST** criteria; this means, each story should be:

- Independent.
- Negotiable.
- Valuable. 
- Estimable.
- Small.
- Testable.

If a story is too small or too big, you can combine or split them, some ways to do either are: Operations, CRUD, Functional/Non Functional.

### Assign US to iterations.

When deciding when to develop each story, you have to keep in mind your team's velocity and the iterations length, the list of work for the release. Finaly set a clear goal for the iteration.

## Some priorization tools.

### MoSCoW

User stories are assigned a letter (M,S,C,W) depending on their priority, that letter is assigned taking in consideration:

| Letter | Meaning |
| :----: | ------- |
| M | ***Must Have:*** A critical feature for the product. |
| S | ***Should Have:*** Not critical but important. |
| C | ***Could Have:*** Feature that would be nice to have. |
| W | ***Won't have:*** Not in this release, probably never. |

### Kano model.

Compare requirements and the satisfaction they bring to the customer. Make a graph.

### Priority Matrices.

- Importance / Urgency
- Risk / Value
- Cost / Value
