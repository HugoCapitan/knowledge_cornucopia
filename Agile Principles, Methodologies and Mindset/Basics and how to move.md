# Agile Principles, Methodologies & Mindset.

> *Agile is about adapting.*

Agile follows and empirical / iterative process. Using experience from previous iterations to improve the end product by constantly evolving requirements and processes, while allowing you to have constant feedback throughout the whole project, thus resulting in great flexibility and capacity to adjust to changes easily.

- Focus on delivering the highest value items FIRST.
- Issues are identified earlier.

## Agile Values

| Primary                      |      | Secondary                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| Individuals and interactions | over | Processes and tools         | 
| Working software             | over | Comprehensive documentation |
| Customer collaboration       | over | Contract negotiation        |
| Responding to change         | over | Following a plan            |

## Agile Principles

1. Satisfy the costumer.
2. Welcome change.
3. Deliver software frequently.
4. Work together.
5. Motivate individuals.
6. Face-to-Face communication.
7. Working software as a measure of progress.
8. Constant pace.
9. Technical excelence.
10. Simplicity.
11. Self-organizing teams.
12. Reflection (Adjust to be better).

## Agile Project Management Model

The model represents a cycle, as agile is a series of iterations or loops. The phases of each iteration are:

1. Envisioning
  
    What this product is going to be, what value ar we delivering.

2. Speculating
    
    How are we going to deliver that value.

3. Exploring

    Developing and figuring how to get to deliver.

4. Adapting

    Using knowledge obtained within previous phases to evolve the final value to deliver.

5. Closing.

You start to work with a high level scope and then refine after each iteration. 

As well as the final product, teams improve with time. Evolving the interactions through the whole project as a result of being self-organized, focusing on a goal. This leads to the distribution of project management responsibilities accross all of the team members.



# Moving to agile.

 - Awareness - of issues
 - Desire - for change
 - Ability - to change
 - Promote - change
 - Transfer - to agile

## Key agile thinking tools

- Top-down intent, bottom-up implementation

    Managers manage from top, but teams are independent and can get to solutions by themselves

- System thinking
- Value streams
- Pragmatism
- Emphasis on the team
- Work in progress limits

## Chosing an agile model

> Agile models can be implemented rigidly, with no deviations, or partially, suited to your needs, or a hybrid model, taking parts from different methodologies.

| Agile Model | Suitability |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| XP | Informal methodology. Good for small dynamic projects with constant requirements change. |
| Scrum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Lightweight, focused on business value and value to the customer. Not strong in documentation nor on rigid processes |
| DSDM | Focused on business value but with complex processes and strict requirements for documentation |
| Lean | Suitable for incorporation with other agile methodologies. Focus on minimizing waste to increase efficiency |
| Crystal | Facilitates scaling of projects. Provides support for development of high criticality functions |
