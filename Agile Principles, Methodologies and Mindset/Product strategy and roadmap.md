# Initiating an agile project.

First stablishes the business case, then develop a vision for the final product; These are usually developed by the customer. By having these two things you:

- Ensure everyone understands what they're trying to achieve. 
- Simplify decision making by setting clear objectives.
- Keep the project team focused.
- Provide key criteria for judging project success.

## Business case

Confirms that a project will create value to the user from the start. It addresses questions about the project's impact (Technical, Economic, Operational, Political).

Components of a business case:

- ***Oportunity.***
- ***Goals:*** Why a project should be implemented, inspire a team.
- ***Strategy:*** Plan to achieve the goals.
- ***Project vision:*** Specifies what the costumers expect from the project when completed.
- ***Milestones:*** Significant points in development and shipping. Make easier to track progress.
- ***Investment:*** What a costumer will need to invest.
- ***Expected payback:*** Return on investment for the costumer and the company.
- ***Expected payback:*** Return on investment for the costumer and the company.

## Product vision

A product vision is a compeling statement about why the product is being built, what benefit it brings, who is it for and why are we building it. It describes how a product can capitalize on the opportunities and fulfill goals on the business case. 

> It should provide everyone with a common understanding of what's required. without limiting the team creativity to achieve the goal.

To create a product vision interview the people who are stakeholders about their vision for the product.

- Interview in a small team and facilitate creative thought.
- Prepare an agenda for the interview.
- Ask open-ended questions. Prone people to answer fully in their own words.
- Ask questions about points of view of other stakeholders.
- Stablish minimum and maximum requirements.
- Investigate risks and benefits.

#### The Vision statement.
 
Focus on how the product will add value, not only on a list of features.

## Chartering a project.

A project charter is a **single-page summary of a project** that can include:

- Vision statement.
- Project objectives/ Mission.
- Success Conditions.
- Priorities and compromises.
- Risks and Mitigation.
- Team roles.

The focus is more on the conversations and information that comes out when creating the charter versus creating a long detailed document.

Stablish alignment on key elements of a project early on. Confirms project goal, crucial elements and target customer and problem.

## Agile contracts

In contrast to traditional projects, fixed price contracts are not very suitable for agile projects since there will be change almost for sure. A fixed price contrast would have various drawbacks, for example, the developers will be bound by legal limitations which will limit easiness to change requirements and improve the product.

There are different types of contracts more suitable for agile projects.

- Service contracts with a series of fixed-price contracts.
- Cost-reimbursable or time-and-materials contracts.
- Not-to-exceed with fixed-fee contracts.
- Incentive contracts.

> You can use different contract types for each development phase.  
> i.e.
> - Initiation phase - Service contract
> - Development phase - Series of fixed-price contracts for each iteration
> 
> It is also important to specify in the contract when the customer will be available to answer questions from the team and the customs turnaround time for acceptance testing, making decisions, answering questions, and providing information.

## Documentation

A key principle of the agile maniphesto is "working software over comprehensive documentation". So an agile approach will focus on keeping docs light. just enough to move forward.

- Project backlog
- Iteration backlog
- User story cards
- Burndown and burnup charts

> Risk is better managed by delivering better value items first instead of having extensive documentation.
