# Estimating the agile way.

Since the agile approach is to welcome chage, chances are that the first estimates for any feature in an agile project will be far from the actuals.

> ***Progressive Elaboration:*** A project in agile is consstantÃ±y modificated and improved. It evolves.

This constant change and uncertainty of estimates leads to the concept of ***The cone of uncertainty***. The uncertainty of estimates reduces over time, since our knowledge about the team's capacity is bigger and we are  more confident of the estimates.

# Agile measuring tools for estimations

## Story Points

These are calculated given the sizes of the stories within the scope of the project, thus these are relative, used to campare complexity between stories, and wrap your mind around the complexity of a story within the project. To calculate story points this should be taken in consideration:

- Complexity
- Risk
- Effort

> Should not be used to estimate time, since these are relative a story for a project with x story points might take double the time for a story with the same points in another project, even further, within the same project two stories with the same quantity of points might have very different development times, since requirements or team capacity can differ.

## Relative Sizing

Used to express the overall size of an item, these are represented either by fibonacci numbers or T-shirt sizes: 

| Extra Small | Small | Medium | Large | Extra Large |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |

## Ideal days

This unit of measure is expresed or represented as the ammount of ideal days it would take one person to finish one story.

An ideal day means no distractions and no multitasking.

> Caution: this way of measuring stories can lead to very very wrong time estimates.

# How to come up with estimates.

## Wideband Delphi

1. Schedule an estimation meeting.
2. Describe wath the team is esimating.
3. Estimate individually.
4. Reveal individual results.
5. Discuss.
6. Repeat until happy.

## Planning Poker
- Use index cards with fibonacci numbers or sizes on them.

1. Each member recieves a set of index cards.
2. Each member offers an estimate using a simple User Story.
3. A high prioritu US is shared.
4. Members select a card.
5. Flip cards face-up simultaneosly.
6. Review
    - Discuss.
    - Re-evaluate.
7. Repeat

## Affinity Estimation

1. Divide a board in categories.

    | XS | S | M | L | XL |
    | -- | - | - | - | -- |

2. Select a task for every category that all the team agrees on.
3. Group the rest.
4. Discuss.
5. Repeat.
