# Basics of Agile Planning.

There are two main planning parts in any agile project.

1. Release planning.
     
    The product vision is shared with the development team to make sure everyone is on the same page. Then create a plan to deliver value in a defined date.

    Important tasks during release planning:
     
    - Establish project goals.
    - Create user stories.
    - Prioritize stories.
    - Estimate stories.
    - Group stories.
    - Set a release date.

2. Iteration planning

    Define specific goals for the next iteration.

    Important tasts:

    - Confirm stories for the next sprint.
    - Decompose stories into tasks.
    - Refine estimates.
    - Update requirements.


## Defining the Project Scope.

The scope is the amount of work that needs to be done to consider the project done. Scope increases during the time of development.

Project owners get to decide if new features stay or not, in order to keep the scope in control while at the same time delivering the maximum value to the customer. 

> ***Scope Creep:*** When the scope goes beyond the original bound. Longer projects are more prone to this.
